# shittiest-forum

This is a bad forum template anyone can use. I have kept it on github for the sake of not having to juggle around many files on usb sticks and floppy disks.

Please, forgive me. It is in node js so it is easy to rework it to your needs.

It sucks, maybe the suck was part of the experience after all, huh?

...

yeah idek what to say, good luck
